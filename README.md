C++ class for a joining and cooperative interruptible thread (std::jthread) with stop_token helper:
- Reference implementation, cleaned up to be used as a polyfill on Mac until libc++ gets an official implementation
- Test suite
- Papers proposing it for the C++ standard
  -  http://wg21.link/p0660  (main proposal for C++20)
     - http://wg21.link/p1287  (initial proposal for stop callbacks, merged with p0660r7)
  -  http://wg21.link/p1869  (additional minor updates for C++20)

Main authors:  Nicolai Josuttis (http://www.josuttis.com/contact.html) and Lewis Baker

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

- Tests for _condition variable_ are not run in CI because this implementation does not work in a single-core environment. We recommend that you do not use CV from this repo until tests are run and passing.
